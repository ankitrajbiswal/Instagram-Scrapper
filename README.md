# Instagram-Scrapper

To scrape data from Instagram, you can use a Python library called "Instaloader." Instaloader provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing various data from Instagram, including user profiles, posts, and more.

To get started, you'll need to install the Instaloader library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

-- pip install instaloader


You can write the code in a Python script file using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. Follow these steps to run the code:

1) Open a text editor or IDE.
2) Create a new file and paste the code into it.
3) Save the file with a .py extension, for example, instagram_scraper.py.

Now, you have your Python script file ready. To execute the code and scrape the data of your following, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Instaloader installed. If not, you can install it by running pip install instaloader in your terminal or command prompt.

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script file using the cd command. For example, if your script is saved in the Desktop directory, you would use cd Desktop.
Run the script by entering python instagram_scraper.py in the terminal or command prompt. Replace instagram_scraper.py with the actual name of your script file if it's different.


The script will start executing, and you should see the usernames and bios of your following being printed to the console.

Remember to replace "your_username" and "your_password" in the code with your own Instagram account credentials before running the script.

Please exercise caution and ensure that you have the necessary permissions and are complying with Instagram's terms of service and any applicable legal requirements when scraping data.
